  <h1>#Synthuary</h1>

  <p>
    Following up from [genuary](http://genuary.art/), we’re going to do synthruary: creative coding and making things for sound each day in the month of February 🎹🎛️🤖🔊⚡. 
  </p>  
  <p>
    This could include: websynths, modular, synth software, super collider, puredata, max, bash, arduino, building instruments, etc. Think of the themes of generative and interactive sound things, it’s pretty open ended in terms of approaches and tools. 
  </p>  
  <p>
    Just like genuary, it’s pretty chill. Hop in for the dailies, or just for a day or two. [Read more about genuary here](http://genuary.art/). [note - you can do one a week, or work on the same thing over days and share progress, or participate daily. Remember what gets you amped about this, be it learning, making things, having fun, etc. ]
  </p>  
  <p>
    You’re invited to share what you make under the tags **#synthruary** and **#synthruary2022** for others to find too.
