  <h1>#Synthuary</h1>

  <p>
    Following up from [genuary](http://genuary.art/), we‚Äôre going to do synthruary: creative coding and making things for sound each day in the month of February üéπüéõÔ∏èü§ñüîä‚ö°. 
  </p>  
  <p>
    This could include: websynths, modular, synth software, super collider, puredata, max, bash, arduino, building instruments, etc. Think of the themes of generative and interactive sound things, it‚Äôs pretty open ended in terms of approaches and tools. 
  </p>  
  <p>
    Just like genuary, it‚Äôs pretty chill. Hop in for the dailies, or just for a day or two. [Read more about genuary here](http://genuary.art/). [note - you can do one a week, or work on the same thing over days and share progress, or participate daily. Remember what gets you amped about this, be it learning, making things, having fun, etc. ]
  </p>  
  <p>
    You‚Äôre invited to share what you make under the tags **#synthruary** and **#synthruary2022** for others to find too.

    <p>
        Following up from <a href="http://genuary.art/">genuary</a>, let's do synthruary:
        creative coding and making things for sound each day in the month of February üéπüéõÔ∏èü§ñüîä‚ö°.
    </p>
    <p>
        This could include: websynths, modular, synth software, super collider, puredata, max,
        bash, arduino, building instruments, etc. Think of the themes of generative and interactive
        sound things, it's pretty open ended in terms of approaches and tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's flexible, participate in a way that works best for you. Hop in for
        the dailies,
        or just for a day or two. So you can do one a week, work on the same thing over several days
        and share progress, or participate daily. Check in on how you feel along the way and note what
        gets you amped about this ‚Äî be it learning, making things, having fun, etc. :)

        You're invited to share what you make under the tags <strong>#synthruary</strong>
