        #SYNTHRUARY
    </h1>
    <p>
        Following up from <a href="http://genuary.art/">genuary</a>, let's do synthruary:
        creative coding and making things for sound each day in the month of February. üéπüéõÔ∏èü§ñüîä‚ö°
    </p>
    <p>
        This could include: websynths, modular, synth software, super collider, puredata, max,
        bash, arduino, building instruments, etc. Think of the themes of generative and interactive
        sound things, it's pretty open ended in terms of approaches and tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's flexible, participate in a way that works best for you. Hop in for
        the dailies,
        or just for a day or two. So you can do one a week, work on the same thing over several days
        and share progress, or participate daily. Check in on how you feel along the way and note what
        gets you amped about this ‚Äî be it learning, making things, having fun, etc. :)
    </p>
    <p>
        You're invited to share what you make under the tags <strong>#synthruary</strong>
        and <strong>#synthruary2022</strong> for others to find too.
    </p>

    <h2>Prompts</h2>
    <p>
        If you'd like some inspo, check out these prompts as a place to start. There's one for each day.
        You can do them by day, or pick any that sing to you, and use them whenever.
